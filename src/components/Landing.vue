      <p>VOICES is a platform that envisions a world where women are equally represented in panels, committees, at local and international events. As women are less likely to proactively seek dissemination of their professional achievements, VOICES aims to encourage women to share their expertise publicly. Firstly, it does so by providing conference organizers with a database of qualified female speakers from all backgrounds with links to their contact details shared by them, such as their LinkedIn profiles. Secondly, VOICES is offering workshops for women from a wide range of expertise on public speaking. These workshops offer an opportunity for women to share best practices, concerns and learn from each other how to disseminate, how to sharpen their public engagement skills.
